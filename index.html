        <p>Hello! My name is Travis Hammon, I am from Syracuse Utah, and I enjoy golfing, going to the movies, spending
            time with family and reading. I have 2 children a boy and a girl ages 12 and 5, they enjoy video games,
            painting, movies, and creating messes. My wife is a pilot and we have spent the last 6 years working on that
            goal now that she is finished i have decided it would be a great time to start school and build a career.
        </p>
